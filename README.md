## philosopher (c project)
### [Project goal](https://github.com/vportens/philosopher/blob/master/philosophers.subject.pdf)

## First step in : 
- Multithreading
- Mutex


## Objectif :
Philosopher must survive !! 
You have n philosopher how's sitting around a round table with only on fork at their right; they can do three thing : 
- eat
- sleep
- wait

But they can't communicate.
For eating a philosopher need two fork ( one at his left and one at his right ), if one of the fork is already used, he has to wait for the user to finish using it.

## Prototype : 
./philo number_of_philosophers time_to_die time_to_eat time_to sleep (number_of_time_each_philosophers_must_eat)
